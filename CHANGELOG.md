# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.0.8] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- **deploy**: add `curl -m 10` timeout to the three remaining
  health-check curl call sites in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  (frontend wait loop, post-deploy backend probe, post-deploy
  frontend probe). The backend wait loop was already fixed in
  4b803ec, but the other three were missed, leaving a 75+ min
  hang risk on a stale Render service. With `-m 10` on all four
  call sites, each `/health` and frontend probe is bounded at
  10s and the 30-iteration loop completes in ≤15 min.

### Security

- **deps-api**: bump `pyarrow` lower bound to `>=23.0.1` for
  **CVE-2026-25087 / GHSA-rgxp-2hwp-jwgg** (high, CVSS 7.0).
  Use-after-free in Apache Arrow C++ IPC file pre-buffering
  (`RecordBatchFileReader::PreBufferMetadata`). The Python
  bindings don't expose the vulnerable C++ API, so this is
  not exploitable from Python code, but the C++ wheel is still
  shipped inside pyarrow. Bumping the lower bound keeps fresh
  installs off the vulnerable range.

### Documentation

- **docs**: add `DEPLOYMENT_VARIANTS.md` — a feature-by-feature
  comparison of Local Docker, VPS, and Render free tier, with a
  matrix of which features (local LLM, web search, persistent
  ChromaDB, PostgreSQL, Redis cache, GPU acceleration, etc.)
  are available in each variant and why. Cross-linked from
  `QUICKSTART.md`, `LOCAL_DEMO.md`, `docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md`,
  and `docs/guides/deployment.md` so the doc is discoverable
  from the existing deployment entry points.

### Notes

- `.gitignore` now explicitly excludes `last.md` (and similar
  `*.claude-session.md` patterns) so Claude / AI session
  transcripts can never accidentally be committed.

## [5.0.7] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **v5.0.6 image was broken at startup.** `langchain-community==0.4.2`
  moved `ChatOllama` out of `langchain_community.chat_models` into the
  standalone `langchain-ollama` package. The v5.0.6 source still had
  `from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOllama`, so the
  container crashed with `ImportError` on every boot. Fix:
  - `apps/api/models/providers/ollama.py`: import now from
    `langchain_ollama`
  - `apps/api/requirements.txt`: add `langchain-ollama>=0.0.1,<1.0.0`

### Added

- `.github/workflows/publish-ghcr.yml`: new `Smoke-test backend image`
  step that boots the just-built image and polls `/health` for 40s
  before declaring the publish-backend job successful. Catches
  future "installs cleanly, crashes at startup" class bugs at CI
  time instead of at customer-deploy time. ~10s of CI cost.

## [5.0.6] - 2026-06-04

### Security

- Close all 75 open GitHub CodeQL code-scanning alerts on the
  `AleksNeStu/ai-real-estate-assistant` public repo:
  - `py/partial-ssrf` (2, critical) — explicit `float()` cast on lat/lon
    in URL interpolation, plus existing allowlist + IP-range guard
  - `py/weak-sensitive-data-hashing` (3, high) — new `hash_fingerprint`
    in `core/security_utils.py` (HMAC-SHA-256 with `$SECURITY_PEPPER`)
    for client-ID fingerprints and at-rest token digests
  - `py/path-injection` (4, high) — `_safe_local_path` in
    `data/excel_loader.py` validates every local file path against
    `ALLOWED_BASE_DIRS` (env-overridable via `EXCEL_ALLOWED_BASE_DIR`)
  - `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` (1, high) — pass station
    name through `redact_sensitive_data` before logging in
    `data/adapters/air_quality_adapter.py`
  - `py/log-injection` (65, medium) — wrap every user-controlled
    value in `sanitize_for_log` / `sanitize_for_logging` across 22
    modules; imports added where missing

### Notes

- Alerts were dismissed in CodeQL with reason `false positive` because
  the custom sanitizer is in place at the call site but CodeQL's
  taint analysis does not recognize `core.security_utils.sanitize_for_log`
  or `utils.sanitization.sanitize_for_logging` as barriers. The
  actual data flow is blocked by the sanitizer.

## [5.0.5] - 2026-06-04

### Security

- Bump starlette 1.0.0 → 1.2.1 (CVE-2026-48710) — missing Host header
  validation could poison `request.url.path` and bypass path-based
  security checks
- Dedupe postcss via npm `overrides: ^8.5.10` (CVE-2026-41305) — the
  vulnerable copy was `next@16.2.6/node_modules/postcss` (< 8.5.10);
  now resolves to 8.5.15 alongside the top-level install. `npm audit`
  reports 0 vulnerabilities

## [5.0.4] - 2026-06-04

### Security

- Log injection remediation: add `core/security_utils.py` (`sanitize_for_log`,
  `validate_file_path`, `validate_osrm_url`, `hash_sensitive_data`, `SecureLogger`)
  and replace 301 unsafe f-string logger calls across 61 backend files with
  parameterized %-format + sanitization
- Bump urllib3 2.6.3 → 2.7.0 (CVE-2026-44432, CVE-2026-44431)
- Bump pillow 12.1.1 → 12.2.0 (CVE-2026-42311, CVE-2026-42310, CVE-2026-42308,
  CVE-2026-42309, CVE-2026-40192)
- Bump cryptography 43.0.3 → 46.0.7 (CVE-2026-26007, CVE-2026-34073,
  CVE-2024-12797) — 3 major versions; verified `data_protection.py` still
  works with Fernet + PBKDF2HMAC APIs
- Bump anthropic 0.86.0 → 0.105.2 (CVE-2026-34452, CVE-2026-34450)
- Bump pytest 9.0.2 → 9.0.3 (CVE-2025-71176)
- Bump tmp 0.1.0 → 0.2.7 and add npm `overrides` to dedupe transitive copies
  in `@lhci/cli` and `external-editor` (CVE-2025-54798)

### Notes

- The Dependabot alert for `postcss` (CVE-2026-41305) remains open because the
  vulnerable copy is `next/node_modules/postcss` (a transitive of `next@16.2.6`),
  not a direct dep. The top-level `postcss@8.5.14` is already patched; closing
  the alert requires bumping `next` (out of scope for this security-only push).

## [5.0.3] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed
